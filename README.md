I present a simple, fully-convolutional model for real-time (> 30 fps) instance segmentation that achieves competitive
results on MS COCO evaluated on a single Titan Xp, which is significantly faster than any previous state-of-the-art approach.
Moreover, we obtain this result after training on only one GPU. We accomplish this by breaking instance segmentation into two parallel
subtasks: (1) generating a set of prototype masks and (2) predicting per-instance mask coefficients. Then we produce instance masks
by linearly combining the prototypes with the mask coefficients. We find that because this process doesnâ€™t depend on repooling, this
approach produces very high-quality masks and exhibits temporal stability for free. Furthermore, we analyze the emergent behavior of
our prototypes and show they learn to localize instances on their own in a translation variant manner, despite being fully-convolutional.
We also propose Fast NMS, a drop-in 12 ms faster replacement for standard NMS that only has a marginal performance penalty.
Finally, by incorporating deformable convolutions into the backbone network, optimizing the prediction head with better anchor scales
and aspect ratios, and adding a novel fast mask re-scoring branch, our YOLACT++ model can achieve 34:1 mAP on MS COCO at 33:5
fps, which is fairly close to the state-of-the-art approaches while still running at real-time.
